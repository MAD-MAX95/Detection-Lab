Pixel Manipulation for Image EncryptionThis repository provides a Python implementation for image encryption through pixel manipulation. The algorithm leverages various pixel transformation techniques to ensure that the original image content is securely encrypted and only recoverable with the appropriate decryption method.
FeaturesPixel Shuffling: Randomly shuffles the pixels in the image to obscure the original content.Color Channel Manipulation: Encrypts images by manipulating the color channels individually.
Key-Based Encryption: Utilizes a key for both encryption and decryption processes.
Support for Multiple Image Formats: Works with standard image formats such as PNG, JPEG etc.
Command-Line Interface: Simple CLI for easy use.
